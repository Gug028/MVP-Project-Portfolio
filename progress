Progress I have made this week on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say an 8.
I am measuring my progress based on the fact that I have managed to do a lot of work towards my portfolio project and am building a portfolio that I am proud to do. I have given myself this rating based on the fact that my time researching for this project has been effective and has yielded good results.
The parts of the project that are completed as planned is the project layout 
The aspects of the project that are incomplete is the coding, and building the app itself.
